Create copies of identical "buttons", except each is uniquely numbered

Basic usage
-----------

1. Build your button template using the normal Gimp tools:

  · Create a layer group named "All buttons", to contain all the elements below
    · Create a second layer group named "Button", as the first child of the "All buttons" layer group
      · Underneath "Button" create as many image layers as you like to build up a pleasing button image
          - Make sure to "Crop to content" each layer
      · Also underneath "Button" create a text layer on top of all the image layers you create
          - Put the number "1" (or any number really) as the content of this text layer
          - Use whatever font and positioning you like
              (often a fixed box, with centered justification works best)

2.  Move this template to the first place on your background image where you'd like a button placed

  · The easiest way to do this is to choose the Move Tool, and enable "Move the active layer" mode
  · Then make the "Button" layer group the active layer
  · You can then drag-and-drop all the layers underneath the "Button" group as a single package

3.  Run the script to create a Button at this location
  
  · Choose "Filters -> Simple Buttons" from the menu.
      - A new layer will be created in this location with the button as it appeared in your template
      - The text of the template will have it's number incremented automatically by 1
      - The template will be directly above the new button, so you will have to move it

4.  Make as many more buttons as you like

  · Drag and drop the template to the next place you want a numbered button
      - The button you created previously will remain behind at the old location
  · Create the next button
      - Instead of using the menu, you can just use the keyboard shortcut "CTRL-F"
